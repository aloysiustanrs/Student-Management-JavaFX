Hi , I created this application to practice my Java skills.

This project was created using JavaFX and scene builder for the FXML files. 
The user can add, edit and delete student data from the table which is connected to the mySQL database using JDBC.

I have learnt these skills:
- JavaFX to create GUI 
- Use maven as a dependency injector to use the JDBC dependency
- Connect the application to mySQL using JDBC
